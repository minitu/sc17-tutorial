| Exercise 3-3. Particles: LiveViz |
------------------------------------

  In this exercise, we use liveViz, a visualization tool in Charm++, to observe
how particles move around in the grid. The particles program acts as the server
whereas liveViz itself becomes the client. Some initialization code is placed
in the Main constructor, and requestNextFrame() gets invoked whenever liveViz
requires the next frame for visualization. Chares in the application are
responsible for implementing this function and should deposit an array of
unsigned chars that correspond to pixels to be shown in liveViz.

1. Compile and Run
------------------
  To compile:
    $ make

  If compilation fails, you may need to be compile the liveViz library first:
    $ cd charm/tmp/libs/ck-libs/liveViz
    $ make

  To run the program with p cores, n particles per cell using a k x k 2D
chare array:
    $ make test P=p N=n K=k

    Default values are P=4, N=100, K=16. You can also pass the port for liveViz
communication to the Makefile (default is 1234).

2. Using liveViz
--------------------
* Docker image users will not be able to perform this step.

  Run the following command to run liveViz with a 800 x 830 window:
    $ ./liveViz localhost 1234 -w 800 -h 830

  If liveViz is currently not installed:
    $ git clone http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/gerrit/ccs_tools
    $ cd ccs_tools
    $ ant
  The liveViz binary will be placed under ccs_tools/bin.
